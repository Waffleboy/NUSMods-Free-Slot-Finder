The study of semantics assumes that such an enterprise is not only possible, but desirable, if we are to properly understand how meaning can be communicated through language. The major topics covered include truth-conditional semantics, quantifiers, variables, variable binding and quantifier movements.", "Department": "English Language & Literature", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EL3880A", "children": [{"name": "and", "children": [[{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "EL1101E", "children": []}, {"name": "GEK1011", "children": []}]}], [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "EL2101", "children": []}, {"name": "EL2201", "children": []}]}]]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
