In the laboratory, they will learn to carry out measurement, data collection, analysis, modelling, interpretation and presentation. The laboratory sessions will be blended with real engineering applications of industrial and societal relevance to Singapore\n.", "Department": "Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "CN1102", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "6"}
