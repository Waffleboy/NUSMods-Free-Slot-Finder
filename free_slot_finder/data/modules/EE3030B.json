The Living Labs (LL) may be rehabilitation centres in hospitals, orphanages, block of HDB flats, hawker centres, etc where good opportunities abound for technology to play a role in overall improvements of such places. Students in this module will spend 3 weeks conducting field work, observing and engaging users in the LL, with the objective of conceptualizing products/services which will benefit a large segment of the users. Students will be encouraged to realize their ideas in the other project modules in the curriculum.", "Department": "Electrical & Computer Engineering", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EE3030B", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "2"}
