As the historical development of design is traced, key principles of design are highlighted. These principles are then described and discussed in greater detail. For the application to problems, students will be working in small groups, interacting with faculty and research staff in an active laboratory where they would be required to think critically and implement solutions to a given \u201cgrand challenge\u201d in an integrated way. The grand challenges\u201d could be everyday problems such as to design a portable kit for making river/sea water drinkable. The final grade will be based on 100% continuous assessment involving assignments, laboratory work and projects.", "Department": "Dean's Office (Engineering)", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2010/2011", "Quota": "50", "Faculty": "Engineering", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "1", "Round": "1C", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Reserved for [G] in later round", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2010/2011", "Quota": "50", "Faculty": "Engineering", "HighestBid": "829", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "1", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "4", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [G]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2010/2011", "Quota": "46", "Faculty": "Engineering", "HighestBid": "1", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "1", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "2", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [G]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2010/2011", "Quota": "44", "Faculty": "Engineering", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "1", "Round": "3A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [G]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2010/2011", "Quota": "44", "Faculty": "Engineering", "HighestBid": "1", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "1", "Round": "3B", "Bidders": "1", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [G]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2011/2012", "Quota": "30", "Faculty": "Engineering", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "1", "Round": "1C", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Reserved for [G] in later round", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2011/2012", "Quota": "30", "Faculty": "Engineering", "HighestBid": "60", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "1", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "3", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P] and NUS Students [G]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2011/2012", "Quota": "27", "Faculty": "Engineering", "HighestBid": "1", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "1", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "1", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P] and NUS Students [G]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2011/2012", "Quota": "27", "Faculty": "Engineering", "HighestBid": "1", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "1", "Round": "3A", "Bidders": "2", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P, G]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2011/2012", "Quota": "25", "Faculty": "Engineering", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "1", "Round": "3B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P, G]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}], "ModmavenTree": {"name": "GEM1505A", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
