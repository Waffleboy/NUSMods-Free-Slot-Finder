Coping with urban growth affects not only those in the city; it affects also those in agricultural belts in rural peri-urban areas which are increasingly threatened by urban sprawl. This module investigates various historical and economic forces shaping urban developments, identifies the elements of urbanism that have a direct impact on the environment (such as transport infrastructure) and offers insights into how sustainability principles can lead to new paradigms for urban rejuvenation and growth.", "Department": "Dean's Office (School Of Design & Env)", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "ISD5105", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
