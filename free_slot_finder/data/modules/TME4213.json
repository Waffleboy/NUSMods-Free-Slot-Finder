Single and multiple-degree-of-freedom systems will be treated using continuous and discrete system concepts, including Lagrange\u2019s equations. Approximation methods for solution as well as instrumentation for vibration measurement will be discussed. Examples will be drawn mainly from mechanical disciplines.", "Department": "School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn", "ParsedPreclusion": {"or": ["TM3213", "ME4213E"]}, "ModmavenTree": {"name": "TME4213", "children": {"name": "TME3112", "children": []}}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
