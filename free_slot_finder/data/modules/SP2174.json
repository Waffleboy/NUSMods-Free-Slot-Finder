Using simple bacteria as the model organism, key chemical and physical principles underlying several biological processes which cells can integrate and function as an autonomous machine in order to regenerate (selfreplicate), repair and re-program (differentiate), respond (energy harness and utilization) and re-model (community formation) will be explored. These processes will be examined at single molecule, single cell to multi-cellular levels under their general ability to store, decode and process information (\u201cInformation\u201d), to self-assemble, migrate (\u201cDynamics\u201d) and to harness and utilise energy (\u201cEnergy\u201d).", "Department": "Dean's Office (Science)", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "SP2174", "children": {"name": "SP2173", "children": []}}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
