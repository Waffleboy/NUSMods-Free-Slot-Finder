This model is applicable to small and open city-state Singapore and enables it to first tap the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) before wider outreaches to billion-plus populated China and India. An ASEAN that is tighter in economic integration is pivotal as China is more aggressively competitive since the 1970s with India awakening as well. This course will focus on ASEAN-plus business opportunities for Singapore-based companies to forge business alliances and ventures to tap natural resources in production and markets for sales and revenue.", "Department": "Strategy And Policy", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "40", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "1", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "3", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching A1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "37", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "1", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1B", "Bidders": "2", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching A1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "35", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching A1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "5", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Reserved for [G] in later round", "Group": "Sectional Teaching A1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "36", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching A1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "5", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [G]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching A1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "41", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P, G]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching A1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "42", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "1", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3B", "Bidders": "1", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P, G]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching A1"}, {"AcadYear": "2016/2017", "Quota": "40", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "127", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "1", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "6", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching B1"}, {"AcadYear": "2016/2017", "Quota": "34", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "1", "Round": "1B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching B1"}, {"AcadYear": "2016/2017", "Quota": "34", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "1", "Round": "1C", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching B1"}, {"AcadYear": "2016/2017", "Quota": "5", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "1", "Round": "1C", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Reserved for [G] in later round", "Group": "Sectional Teaching B1"}, {"AcadYear": "2016/2017", "Quota": "39", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "1", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P] and NUS Students [G]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching B1"}, {"AcadYear": "2016/2017", "Quota": "41", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "1", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P] and NUS Students [G]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching B1"}, {"AcadYear": "2016/2017", "Quota": "41", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "1", "Round": "3A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P, G]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching B1"}, {"AcadYear": "2016/2017", "Quota": "41", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "1", "Round": "3B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P, G]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching B1"}], "ModmavenTree": {"name": "BSP3516", "children": [{"name": "and", "children": [{"name": "BSP1005", "children": []}, {"name": "BSP2001", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
