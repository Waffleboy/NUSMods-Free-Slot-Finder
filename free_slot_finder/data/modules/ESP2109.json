Students have to design various experiments to determine for example the Youngs modulus of metallic and non-metallic beams/rods and to estimate the errors of the material properties. The second part of this module will focus on a reaction, mass transfer and/or heat transfer problem and involve designing either transient or steady-state experiments/prototypes. The objectives range from for example determining the reaction order, rate constants, and mass/heat transfer coefficients to designing large-scale industrial equipment, where the latter is related to the small-scale prototypes/experiments. In both projects, students will be involved in making measurements, setting up model equations (differential equations), solving them analytically or numerically, and optimising the model fit to the experimental data.", "Department": "Engineering Science Programme", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "ESP2109", "children": [{"name": "and", "children": [{"name": "ESP1104", "children": []}, {"name": "ESP1107", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
