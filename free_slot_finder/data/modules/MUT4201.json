These include 4-part voice leading, 18th century contrapuntal techniques, post-tonal analysis, and common forms. This module assumes students are already familiar with these skills but are in need of reviewing them before entering graduate school. It is, therefore, appropriate for fourth year conservatory students whose future plans include graduate level studies in music.", "Department": "Yong Siew Toh Conservatory Of Music", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "MUT4201", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
