Topics include: concepts and classification of stochastic processes; special processes (binary transmission, telegraph, random walk, Wiener-Levy, Poisson); transmission of stochastic processes through systems; stochastic integrals and ergodicity; bandlimited processes; Gaussian processes; Markov processes; Markov chains; counting processes. These topics will be treated with sufficient mathematical rigour so that students will learn various statistical concepts and their inter-relationships in the way of a connected theory.", "Department": "Electrical & Computer Engineering", "ParsedPreclusion": "EE5306", "ModuleCredit": "4"}
