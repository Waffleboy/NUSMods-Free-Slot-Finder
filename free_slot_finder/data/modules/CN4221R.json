The course will cover the systematic design of a regulatory control system with the aid of heuristics and computer-aided simulation tools. Students will be introduced to dynamic (real-time) simulation of chemical processes. Active learning techniques will be employed throughout. As part of the assessment, students will get to work hands-on with a project to design and simulate PWC systems for a chemical plant. Students are also assessed by means of a class test, and small individual assignments.", "Department": "Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "CN4221R", "children": {"name": "CN3121", "children": []}}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
