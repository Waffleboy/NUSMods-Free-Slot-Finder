Computational models of electrophysiology have proven to be a valuable tool in gaining an insight into the pathophysiology of many diseases. In this module we will look in depth at the underlying basis for electrophysiology across a range of spatial scales and how these phenomena can be modelled computationally.", "Department": "Biomedical Engineering", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "BN6402", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
