The topics will include consumer and producer theories, analysis of risk and uncertainty, game theory and its applications in economics, general equilibrium, market failure and welfare economics. The course considers the problem of incomplete and asymmetric information in market interactions, including the issues of moral hazard, adverse selection, and signaling.
