It is tailored for students who are pursuing research in the field of advanced control systems. The topics covered include: Principles of single- and multi-loop feedback designs; poles, zeros and stability of multivariable feedback systems; performance and robustness of multivariable feedback systems; control system design using LQR technique, LQG/LTR method, H2 and H-infinity control, and computer aided design software. Students taking this module will need to complete a self-study project on an advanced topic.", "Department": "Electrical & Computer Engineering", "ParsedPreclusion": "EE5102", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EE6102", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "EE5101", "children": []}, {"name": "EE5101R", "children": []}, {"name": "ME5401", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
