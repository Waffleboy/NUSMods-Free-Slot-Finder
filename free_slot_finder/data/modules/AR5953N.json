The module provides an opportunity to understand tools and techniques of Rapid Prototyping process in architectural designs with Digital Fabrication technologies. It commences with case studies of how prototypes can advance aesthetical, structural and environmental aspects of architectural design, which are followed by workshop based hands-on exercises on actual prototype making at the Design Fabrication Workshop.", "Department": "Architecture", "ModuleCredit": "4"}
