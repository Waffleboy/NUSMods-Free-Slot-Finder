This module develops a solid understanding of the fundamentals of linear systems analysis and design using the state space approach. Topics covered include state space representation of systems; solution of state equations; stability analysis using Lyapunov methods; controllability and observability; linear state feedback design; asymptotic observer and compensator design, decoupling and servo control. This module is a must for higher degree students in control engineering, robotics or servo engineering. It is also very useful for those who are interested in signal processing and computer engineering.", "Department": "Electrical & Computer Engineering", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "ME5401", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "EE4302", "children": []}, {"name": "ME4246", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
