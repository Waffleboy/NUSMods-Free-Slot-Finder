The experiments are designed to strengthen the students\u2019 understanding of basic organic,\ninorganic and physical chemistry. Upon completion of the module, students should have learnt some essential laboratory skills and be able to perform basic data processing and write lab reports. In addition to the aforementioned activities, CM1191 will also cover errors in chemical analysis which will be taught during the lectures.", "Department": "Chemistry", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "CM1191", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
