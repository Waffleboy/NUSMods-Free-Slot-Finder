Although MNEs remain creations of domestic law, the cross-border activities of MNEs increasingly come within the scope of instruments creating obligations and/or rights in international law. In assessing the challenges faced by states and MNEs alike with respect to such transnational regulation, the module takes a rounded and interdisciplinary view of the issues involved, addressing both the commercial and social dimensions of MNE action. In addition to considering the regulatory powers of individual states, developments under international instruments on human rights, labour conditions, finance, taxation and investment are addressed.", "Department": "Law", "ParsedPreclusion": {"or": ["LL4335", "LL5335"]}, "ModmavenTree": {"name": "LL6335V", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
