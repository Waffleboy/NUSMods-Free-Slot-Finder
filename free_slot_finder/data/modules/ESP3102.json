The fabrication part will facus on top-down techniques which will complement the bottom-up techniques covered by CM3251 Nanochemistry. Topics to be covered include: Nanofabrication: thin flim deposition, etching, photolithography, EUV, electron beam, x-ray and ion beam lithography, focused ion beam and direct laser writing, scanning probe based techniques, fabrication and alignment of nanostructures, manufacturing of nanodevices and nanosystems. Nanocharacterization: basic principle of imaging, wave diffraction, interaction of energy beams with materials, optical and electron microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, x-ray microanalysis, electron transport measurement, magnetic measurement and optical spectroscopy.", "Department": "Engineering Science Programme", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "ESP3102", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "PC2130B", "children": []}, {"name": "PC2133", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
