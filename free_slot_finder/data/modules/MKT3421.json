This course follows up on the marketing core course by operationalizing several marketing concepts such as segmentation, targeting, positioning, and marketing resource allocation. By the end of this course, you will learn how to segment customers, recognize different ways to segment markets, understand the data required for segmentation, identify attractive customers to target, determine the best positioning of your brand in customers\u2019 minds, and develop new products that add value to consumers and firms. The course is designed for students who have extensive background in or understanding marketing research and marketing principles, and who know or are prepared to learn to build \u201csmart\u201d spreadsheets in EXCEL.
