The topics covered are: quantum mechanical approach of light and transition; absorption spectroscopy; linear and circular dichroism of biological molecules; emission spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy and applications to biomacromolecules; NMR; equilibria of macromolecular solutions; biomembrane structure and transport of macromolecules and transport across biomembranes; kinetics and techniques of protein crystallization; biomineralization/demineralization in human body. This module also includes a lab component. This module is targeted at both physics and non-physics students who already have a basic knowledge in physics, thermodynamics and molecular biology.", "Department": "Physics", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "PC5213", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "PC4267", "children": []}, {"name": "PC4268", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
