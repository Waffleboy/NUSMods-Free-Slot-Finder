The student is expected to acquire an understanding of the role of thermodynamic reasoning and kinetic analysis in providing a deeper insight into many biochemical and biophysical problems. The topics covered will include thermodynamic functions, chemical potential, chemical reaction and phase equilibria, multicomponent systems, electrochemical potential, solubility, ligand binding equilibria, calorimetry, enzyme kinetics, microbial fermentation, ligand binding kinetics.", "Department": "Biomedical Engineering", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "BN3501", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "MA1506", "children": []}, {"name": "PC1432", "children": []}, {"name": "CN2122", "children": []}, {"name": "ME2134", "children": []}, {"name": "BN2202", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
