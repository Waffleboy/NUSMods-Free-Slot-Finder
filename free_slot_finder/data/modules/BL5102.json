It discusses the earth's environmental dimensions of air, water and land, and the interaction between living and non-living components. Earth is considered as a system through which materials are continuously cycled. Impacts caused by natural or human influences affect the state of balance, leading to environmental problems, with human impacts causing more serious consequences to the environment and human society. The module covers the properties of air, water and land, ecosystems, biogeochemical cycles, ecosystem integrity and environmental capacity, pollution pathways and impacts, conservation science, integrated management approaches. The emphasis is to provide a sound understanding of the scientific basis for better environmental decision-making. Targeted Students - For students on the M.Sc. (Environmental Management) program. Research students and students from other graduate programmes in NUS may apply subject to suitability of candidate and availability of places.", "Department": "Dean's Office (School Of Design & Env)", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "BL5102", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
