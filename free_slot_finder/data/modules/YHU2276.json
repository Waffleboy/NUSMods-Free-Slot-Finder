Students will develop skills at writing in contrapuntal textures in two and three parts. Following from this, lectures will focus on the hierarchical principles that govern the motion and organization of sonorities and students will develop skills at manipulating harmonic textures in four parts. There will be an opportunity to have these vocal compositions recorded and performed.
