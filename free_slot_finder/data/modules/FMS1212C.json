We are living in a fast-developing modern society, and \u201csustainable development\u201d is an extremely important global challenge. Green Chemistry is an emerging science focusing on principles that prevent or minimize waste production, thus providing a viable solution to sustainability. Topics to be discussed include: green chemistry and sustainability, principles of green chemistry, green chemistry tools/approaches towards sustainability.", "Department": "Chemistry", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "12", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "150", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "1", "Round": "1C", "Bidders": "10", "StudentAcctType": "New Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class Sl1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "2", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "597", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "107", "Semester": "1", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "2", "StudentAcctType": "New Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class Sl1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "1", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "1", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "New Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class Sl1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "4", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "500", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "500", "Semester": "1", "Round": "3A", "Bidders": "1", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class Sl1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "3", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "1609", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1609", "Semester": "1", "Round": "3B", "Bidders": "1", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class Sl1"}], "ModuleCredit": "4"}
