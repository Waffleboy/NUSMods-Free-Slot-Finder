Beginning with the foundation of a rational consumer, we systematically examine the choice, purchase and shopping behaviors which deviate from standard rational predictions, the circumstances/contexts of such deviations, and understand their causes and consequences. Key elements underlying choice, purchase and shopping are examined under a generic context before moving to specific contexts such as personal finance, health and consumption.", "Department": "Marketing", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "29", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "3000", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1555", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "51", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching A1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "3", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Reserved for [G] in later round", "Group": "Sectional Teaching A1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "3", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Reserved for [G] in later round", "Group": "Sectional Teaching A1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "3", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "3877", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1678", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3A", "Bidders": "12", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching A1"}], "ModmavenTree": {"name": "MKT4417", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
