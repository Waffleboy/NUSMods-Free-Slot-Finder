Topics covered include motion in one dimension; curvilinear motion; circular motion; relative motion; Newton's laws; friction; work and energy; conservative forces, conservation of energy; linear momentum and conservation, collisions; rotational kinematics; moment of inertia and torque; rotational dynamics; conservation of angular momentum; temperature and the zeroth law, temperature scales; heat and internal energy, specific heat capacities, work for ideal gases, first law of thermodynamics; equipartition of energy, entropy and the second law, heat engines; entropy changes for reversible and irreversible processes. The module is targeted essentially at Engineering students.", "Department": "Physics", "ParsedPreclusion": "PC1431F", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "PC1431X", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
