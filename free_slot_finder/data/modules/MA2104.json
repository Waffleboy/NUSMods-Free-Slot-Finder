The aim is for students to acquire computational skills, ability for 2- and 3-D visualisation and to understand conceptually fundamental results such as Green\u2019s Theorem, Stokes\u2019 Theorem and the Divergence Theorem. Major topics: Euclidean distance and elementary topological concepts in Rn, limit and continuity, implicit functions. Partial differentiation, differentiable functions, differentials, chain rules, directional derivatives, gradients, mean value theorem, Taylor\u2019s formula, extreme value theorem, Lagrange multipliers.\nMultiple integrals and iterated integrals, change of order of integration, applications, Jacobian matrix, change of variables in multiple integrals. Line integrals and Green\u2019s theorem. Surface integrals, Stokes\u2019 Theorem, Divergence Theorem.", "Department": "Mathematics", "ParsedPreclusion": {"or": ["MA1104", "MA2311", "MA1507"]}, "ModmavenTree": {"name": "MA2104", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "MA1102R", "children": []}, {"name": "MA1505", "children": []}, {"name": "MA1521", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
