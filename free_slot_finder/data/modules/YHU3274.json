Taking Edward Said\u2019s seminal definition of Orientalism as a point of departure, students will investigate the historical processes by which Europeans conceptualized and represented the \u201cOrient\u201d both at the moment of initial colonial encounter and during subsequent imperial expansion. Students will analyze a number of masterpieces of Orientalist painting alongside key literature. Students will engage with different theoretical positions and methodologies, exploring how the legacy of Orientalism continues to influence our perceptions of the East/West binary to this day.", "Department": "Yale-NUS College", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "YHU3274", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
