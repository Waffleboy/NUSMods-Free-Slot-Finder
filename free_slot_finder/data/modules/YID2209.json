We investigate how these different spheres interact, and how scientists measure the changes in these realms. Topics include the theory of plate tectonics, the dynamics of atmospheric circulation, and the fundamentals of biogeochemical cycling as the foundation of ecosystems. Students will engage in data collection and analysis, and compare their analyses to current knowledge as documented in the scientific literature.", "Department": "Yale-NUS College", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "YID2209", "children": {"name": "YID1201", "children": []}}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
