It gives students a good understanding of the differences between single loop and multi-loop systems, in terms of both analysis and synthesis. The topics covered include: Principles of single- and multi-loop feedback designs; poles, zeros and stability of multivariable feedback systems; performance and robustness of multivariable feedback systems; control system design using LQR technique, LQG/LTR method, H2 and H-infinity control, and computer aided design software.", "Department": "Electrical & Computer Engineering", "ParsedPreclusion": "EE6102", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EE5102", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "EE5101", "children": []}, {"name": "EE5101R", "children": []}, {"name": "ME5401", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
