Yet sex in the animal world is in fact aggressive, competitive, stressful and sometimes fatal. Every animal tries hard to reproduce but each sex is profoundly in conflict with whom it mates and how much it invests into raising its offspring. This module allows students to explore the study of sex in the animal world and the rapid advances in sexual selection, learn how research on sexual selection is done, and decipher the future direction in research on sexual selection.", "Department": "Biological Sciences", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2014/2015", "Quota": "12", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "1254", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1175", "LowestBid": "250", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "20", "StudentAcctType": "New Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class Sl1"}, {"AcadYear": "2014/2015", "Quota": "3", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "1265", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1254", "LowestBid": "500", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "6", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class Sl1"}], "ModuleCredit": "4"}
