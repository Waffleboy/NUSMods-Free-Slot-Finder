The main topics that will be covered are: single and multilayer perceptrons, support vector machines, radial basis function networks, Kohonen networks, principal component analysis, and recurrent networks. There is a compulsory computer project for this module. This module is intended for graduate students and engineers interested in learning about neural networks and using them to solve real world problems.", "Department": "Electrical & Computer Engineering", "ModuleCredit": "4"}
