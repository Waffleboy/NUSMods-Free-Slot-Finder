At the outset, students are required to select at least 4 specialized topics to focus on, from: (i) NMR spectroscopy, (ii) Mass spectrometry, (iii) Elemental and thermal analysis, (iv) Chromatography and hyphenated techniques, (v) Single crystal and powder X-ray crystallography, (vi) Scanning probe and microscopic techniques. Besides learning the scientific fundamentals through recorded lectures/seminars and online assessments, students work directly with instrumental experts in the various laboratories to gain hands-on knowledge and practical aspects of each of these techniques.", "Department": "Chemistry", "ParsedPreclusion": "CM5201", "ModuleCredit": "4"}
