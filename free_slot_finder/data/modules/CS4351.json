Recent rendering techniques have been heavily exploiting the powerful graphics hardware to achieve unprecedented performance and effects. In this module, students study the modern real-time rendering pipeline and GPU architecture, learn about modern and traditional real-time rendering techniques, and write shaders to implement these techniques for the GPU. The syllabus includes multiple-pass rendering; shading and reflection models; procedural texture-mapping and shading; lights and shadows; noise and natural materials; non-photorealistic rendering; volume rendering; deferred shading; scene management; post-rendering processing; performance analysis and optimization.", "Department": "Computer Science", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "CS4351", "children": {"name": "CS3241", "children": []}}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
