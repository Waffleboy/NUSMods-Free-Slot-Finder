They will study various methods of linear, nonlinear and mixed-integer linear programming, which would enable them to select and use appropriate algorithm and/or software for solving a given problem. They will also execute the various steps in optimization by solving selected practical problems via various case studies as well as a term project. This is for undergraduate students who wish to learn optimization methodology to solve real-life problems in research and chemical industry.", "Department": "School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn", "ParsedPreclusion": "CN4242E", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "TCN4242", "children": [{"name": "and", "children": [{"name": "TCN2411", "children": []}, {"name": "TCN3421", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
