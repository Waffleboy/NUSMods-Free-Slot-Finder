This module aims to introduce students to an elementary comprehension of war as a form of politics. A philosophical approach will be taken towards an exposition of general theories of war, as well as land, air, sea, guerrilla and nuclear warfare. It will round off by inquiring whether war studies should necessarily encompass human security today. In this way, the field becomes open to Critical Theory and Postmodern perspectives as well. Students are strongly encouraged to read PS2237 Introduction to International Relations before signing up.", "Department": "Political Science", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "24", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "2078", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "900", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "1", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "35", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2016/2017", "Quota": "24", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "1400", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "1", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "22", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2016/2017", "Quota": "2", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "1102", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "400", "LowestBid": "36", "Semester": "1", "Round": "1B", "Bidders": "3", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2016/2017", "Quota": "1", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "2557", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "2557", "LowestBid": "800", "Semester": "1", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "3", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2016/2017", "Quota": "1", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "2701", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "2701", "LowestBid": "1000", "Semester": "1", "Round": "3B", "Bidders": "5", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}], "ModmavenTree": {"name": "PS4216", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
