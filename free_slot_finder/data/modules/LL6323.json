Agency problems are pervasive throughout the law: they are not confined to professional agents nor even to commercial law. We all act through and deal with agents the whole time. In the case of corporations, having no physical personality they can only deal through human agents. Most applications of agency reasoning are in the law of contract, but they also may arise in the law of tort, property and elsewhere.", "Department": "Law", "ParsedPreclusion": {"or": ["LL4323V", "LL5323V"]}, "ModmavenTree": {"name": "LL6323", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
