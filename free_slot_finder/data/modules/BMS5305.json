This module differs from a typical corporate finance module in that it highlights the special and unique considerations when planning the financial needs of new or young ventures. Many conventional means of funding (such as bank borrowings, issuance of bonds or public equities) for established or public listed companies are generally not available to small and young companies due to their lack of business track record. This module will highlight the various means of fund raising for new or young ventures, with special emphasis on the analyses and requirements of the professional venture capital funds, which have made significant contributions in nurturing many promising young companies into multi-billion dollar listed corporations in the past decades.", "Department": "Dean's Office (Biz)", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "BMS5305", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
