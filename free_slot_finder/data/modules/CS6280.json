Controlling slow response times results in more efficient server use, which is worth literally millions of dollars within the datacenter industry. This module focuses on understanding and controlling the sources of latency in a datacentre, especially the long-tail delays that ruin a user experience. The module offers a hands on component where students will perform measurement studies on the latency of various software and hardware subsystems, and investigate the unexpected ways that these layers interact.", "Department": "Computer Science", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "CS6280", "children": [{"name": "and", "children": [[{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "CS2010", "children": []}, {"name": "CS2020", "children": []}]}], {"name": "CS2100", "children": []}, {"name": "CS3211", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
