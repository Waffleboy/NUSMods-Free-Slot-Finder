After a general introduction, inter-atomic potentials, cross sections and stopping powers are discussed, and the theory of the stopping process is developed based on the Thomas-Fermi statistical atom. Accelerators and other instrumentation are introduced, and a range of analytical techniques is discussed in detail: Rutherford Backscattering (RBS), Proton Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE), Elastic Recoil Detection Analysis (ERDA), Nuclear Reaction Analysis NRA, and Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS). Finally, the more specialised fields of Nuclear Microscopy and Synchrotron radiation are discussed.", "Department": "Physics", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "PC5209", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "PC4244", "children": []}, {"name": "PC4212", "children": []}, {"name": "PC4261", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
