Their IV characteristic in different operating region and their impact on the performance of logic gate will also be discussed. It explains the foundational concepts of inverters and analyses their performance in terms of power and delay trade-off. It also introduces logic synthesis and the fundamental timing analysis of logic gates. Besides the static CMOS logic, it will also cover pass logics or transmission gates logics.", "Department": "Computing & Engineering", "ParsedPreclusion": "EE2021", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "CG2027", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "CG1111", "children": []}, {"name": "CG1108", "children": []}, {"name": "EG1112", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "2"}
