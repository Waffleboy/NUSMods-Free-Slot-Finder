This is a two-part module: Industrial and Systems Engineering Principles and Practice (EPP) I and II. Real engineering systems will be used to show how engineers use different disciplines of engineering, and combine them to design, make and test systems. Through grasping engineering fundamentals, students learn how engineering systems work and fail (EPP I). Through learning of real systems, students learn how multi-disciplinary concepts are tied together (EPP II). The students will also learn basic design, experimentation and evaluation of engineering systems.", "Department": "Industrial Systems Engineering & Mgt", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "IE1112", "children": {"name": "IE1111", "children": []}}, "ModuleCredit": "6"}
