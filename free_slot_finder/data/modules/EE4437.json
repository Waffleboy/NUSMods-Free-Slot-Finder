Emphasis is placed on the fundamentals of\ndevice operation and their use in current photonic devices\nand applications. The aim is to equip students to meet the\ndemand of the expanding optoelectronic industry and to\nprepare them for advanced study and research in photonic\ntechnology. Topics include introduction to photometry, and\nelectro-optical properties of semiconductors and lowdimensional\nsemiconductor structures, as well as\napplications such as light emitting devices, lasers,\ndetectors, modulators and displays. Recent advances e.g.\nquantum devices, and organic LEDs and photonic crystals\nwill also be introduced.", "Department": "Electrical & Computer Engineering", "ParsedPreclusion": "EE4401", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EE4437", "children": {"name": "EE2021", "children": []}}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
