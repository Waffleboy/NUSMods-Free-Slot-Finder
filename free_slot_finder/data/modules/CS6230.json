Selected topics may include classical issues such as provable security, design of symmetric key ciphers, and public key cryptography, as well as emerging topics, such as pairing-based cryptography, homomorphic encryption, privacy-preserving methods, information hiding, and data forensic. Other topics of current research interests may also be included.", "Department": "Computer Science", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "CS6230", "children": [{"name": "and", "children": [{"name": "CS4236", "children": []}, {"name": "CS5321", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
