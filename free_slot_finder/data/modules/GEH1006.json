If such a link does in fact exist, can we study it in a tangible and scholarly manner? Furthermore, does such a link have anything to tell us about cultural traditions? This course attempts to answer these questions from a uniquely Chinese perspective. Using primary and secondary source materials from past and present, we will draw on the rich Chinese musical, linguistic and literary traditions in dealing with these questions.", "Department": "Chinese Studies", "ParsedPreclusion": "GEK1053", "ModuleCredit": "4"}
