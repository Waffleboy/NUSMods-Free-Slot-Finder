The topics introduce\nthe fundamentals of material constitutive\nbehaviours and failure models to appreciate the\nuse of materials in structural design. The topics\nalso cover the applications of concrete and steel as\nstructural materials including its properties, design\nand quality control in practice. The module is\ncompulsory for civil engineering undergraduate\nstudents without which he will not be qualified to\npractise as a professional civil engineer.", "Department": "School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn", "ParsedPreclusion": "CE2155", "ModuleCredit": "4"}
