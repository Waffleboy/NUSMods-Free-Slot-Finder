Often this data is distributed online among many web pages, stored in databases or available in large text files, and may be too large to obtain or process manually. Instead, we need an automated way to gather, parse and summarize the data before we can do more advanced analysis. This module explores ways to accomplish these tasks in quick and easy yet useful and repeatable ways. The ultimate goal is to glean insights from the data through analysis and basic visualizations.", "Department": "Communications And New Media", "Types": ["UEM"], "ModuleCredit": "4"}
