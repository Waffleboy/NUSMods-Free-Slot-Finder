Tools acquired and the understanding gained through this course include: formulation of the mathematical models of physical systems and development of solutions to boundary- and initial-value problems arising in fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and solid mechanics as well as in interdisciplinary areas as such as nanomechanics and biomechanics.", "Department": "Engineering Science Programme", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "ESP4206", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "MA2501", "children": []}, {"name": "ME2113", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
