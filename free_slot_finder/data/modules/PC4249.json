The endstages (brown dwarfs, white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes) are discussed in detail. In the second part of the module, large structures in the universe, are discussed, including star clusters, galaxy structure, and galaxy clustering. The module ends with a discussion of the cosmological scale structure of the universe. This module is a continuation of PC3246 Astrophysics I.", "Department": "Physics", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "PC4249", "children": {"name": "PC3246", "children": []}}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
