Businesses are faced with myriad ways of identifying, developing or acquiring and deploying technologies. Organisations of different sizes in different clusters will have different technology needs at various stages of their growth. Different types of technology bring about different types of organizational change, and managers should tailor their own roles accordingly. Technology for organisational productivity and technology to enable the organisation to create new revenue streams need to be differentiated and tackled with different methodologies. Categorizing technologies in this manner can help leaders determine which technologies and when to invest in and how they can assist organizations in making the most of them.", "Department":
