Underlying this is the question of performance; who defines it and what it means at local and global levels. Of these, vernacular solutions and indigenous knowledge speak of climate and context, shaping demand for resources and occupant well being. Technology and system-driven approaches dwell on the efficacies of resource and waste management. Integration of the two, selectively and critically, is critical to the future Green buildings in Asia. This module will examine from first principles the constituents of Green performance; it will contextualise these for tropical and subtropical conditions, addressing urban, suburban and rural typologies that are important to Asia.", "Department": "Dean's Office (School Of Design & Env)", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "ISD5103", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
