In this course, we will closely examine his Shiji as a seminal act of historiographical creation, as we study its precursors and innovations, its conventions and literary devices, and its expressed and unexpressed motivations and the way in which such impulses contributed to Sima Qian\u2019s acts of source selection and narrative construction and his critical evaluation of both his evidentiary sources and the historical figures themselves.", "Department": "Yale-NUS College", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "YHU4222", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
