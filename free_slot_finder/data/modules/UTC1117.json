In this seminar, we adopt a multi-disciplinary approach to debates and controversies about radiation and nuclear technology. Key topics include: (1) the science behind radiation effects, and the way in which policymakers and others grapple with scientific uncertainties; (2) the challenges of expert-lay communication about radiation risk, both after nuclear disaster and relating to consumer technologies; (3) the broader context that shapes debates over nuclear power in Japan and elsewhere.", "Department": "Tembusu College", "ParsedPreclusion": {"or": ["GEM2910", "GEM2910X", "UTC2110"]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
