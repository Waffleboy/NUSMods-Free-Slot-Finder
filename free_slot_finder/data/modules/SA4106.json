Based on a User Requirement Statement given to the students, they will go through a complete software development life cycle to develop and deliver the required system. The students will capture requirements through user interviews, produce a feasible design of the system, code, test and implement the solution in a distributed platform. This project provides a simulation of the real-life IT working environment, and tests their strengths in working closely as a project team.", "Department": "Institute Of Systems Science", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "SA4106", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "6"}
