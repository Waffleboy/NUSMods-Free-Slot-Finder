Thereafter, this module will launch into the specifics of the main IP rights including copyright, patents and trade marks. For each of these IP rights, selected issues relating to their subsistence (how does it arise; is registration needed; what are the registration criteria) and infringement (what exclusive rights the IP owner has; what defences are available) will be examined very closely.
