One may say \"all literature is ideological\", but this course raises doubts that \"everything is political\" in a significant way. This course examines the differences between \"ideology\" and \"politics\" in relation to literature. The course considers works that challenge conventional distinctions such as that between \"propaganda\" and \"literature\".
