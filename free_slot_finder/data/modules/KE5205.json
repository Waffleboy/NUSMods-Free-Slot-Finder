The students will be introduced to the concepts, techniques, and methods for common text mining tasks, such as data pre-processing and preparation, linguistic/knowledge resources management, concept extraction, text categorization, clustering, association analysis, and trend detection. The scenario-based case studies will enable the students to understand the application of text mining in business and research context, whereas hands-on workshops will allow them to practice performing the above mining tasks following a text mining process.", "Department": "Institute Of Systems Science", "ModuleCredit": "3"}
