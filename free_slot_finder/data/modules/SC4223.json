First, an important goal of the module is to clarify the extent to which mental and physical health/illness have been socially constructed and unevenly distributed in society. The module further identifies the effects of such social conditions as socioeconomic status, education, gender, and social networks on patterns of health inequality. Finally, it delves into specific issues like social epidemiology, stress process, and health care where possible causal relationships between a variety of social forces and health/illness are explored.", "Department": "Sociology", "ParsedPreclusion": "SC4214A", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2012/2013", "Quota": "45", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "3000", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "102", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "49", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2013/2014", "Quota": "45", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "2186", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "33", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2013/2014", "Quota": "12", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2013/2014", "Quota": "12", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "550", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "550", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "1", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2013/2014", "Quota": "14", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "2372", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "178", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "14", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "5", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "1887", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "5", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3A", "Bidders": "2", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "3", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "1217", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "500", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3B", "Bidders": "2", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}], "ModmavenTree": {"name": "SC4223", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
