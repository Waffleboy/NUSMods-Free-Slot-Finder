Nanophotonics has successfully penetrated many fields including biological sciences and optics, and has emerged as a candidate to bridge the gap between photonics and electronics. The goal of this module is to provide the student with a foundation in this rapidly developing area.", "Department": "Engineering Science Programme", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "ESP4302", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "ESP2104", "children": []}, {"name": "PC2131", "children": []}, {"name": "EE2011", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
