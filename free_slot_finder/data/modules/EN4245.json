Through close analysis of the work of three different directors, we will: 1) explore the relationship between form, ideology and narrative, and the influence of the socio-cultural context on storytelling and meaning making; 2) pursue and evaluate the auteur theory - Who is an author, specifically in film, where teamwork is everything? What makes a director an auteur? What cultural and/or ideological implications reside in the development, alteration or evolution of an auteur's style?", "Department": "English Language & Literature", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EN4245", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
