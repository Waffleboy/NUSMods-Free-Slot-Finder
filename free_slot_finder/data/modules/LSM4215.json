Latest research findings, including some of the controversial topics, will be presented and discussed. Students will understand what the physiological changes are under extreme conditions and how acute and chronic adaptations occur in response to these stresses. This will allow students to appreciate how the human body adapts to changing environments.", "Department": "Physiology", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2013/2014", "Quota": "40", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "3881", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "2456", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "62", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Lecture Sl1"}, {"AcadYear": "2014/2015", "Quota": "40", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "4023", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1789", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "53", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Lecture Sl1"}, {"AcadYear": "2014/2015", "Quota": "1", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "1956", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1956", "LowestBid": "750", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3B", "Bidders": "3", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Lecture Sl1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "40", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "4534", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "2689", "LowestBid": "648", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "57", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Lecture Sl1"}], "ModmavenTree": {"name": "LSM4215", "children": [{"name": "and", "children": [{"name": "LSM3212", "children": []}, {"name": "LSM3214", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
