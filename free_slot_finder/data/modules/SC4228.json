How is violence materialized, contested and reproduced? What can anthropology offer to understandings of violence? Exploring phenomena ranging from war, genocide and terrorism to domestic abuse, poverty and crime, this course examines violence as a domain of cultural understanding and a mode of social action. Involving both overt and spectacular expressions and implicit and everyday forms, our understandings of violence will span the intimacy of the family, the nationalisms of states and the economics of global corporations. Through the comparison of cross-cultural ethnographies, we look critically at the theoretical, empirical, methodological and ethical implications of analysing violence.", "Department": "Sociology", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "SC4228", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
