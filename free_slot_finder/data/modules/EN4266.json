The texts will be approached as reflecting conflicts of neo/colonialisms and the complications of modernities, as grappling with issues of gendered and racialized identities; as explorations of issues relating to the underside of globalisation. Students should gain a fairly in-depth knowledge of leading literary works from South Asia. They will also need to produce a final term paper that will potentially be expandable to an Honours thesis.", "Department": "English Language & Literature", "ParsedPreclusion": "EN3265", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EN4266", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
