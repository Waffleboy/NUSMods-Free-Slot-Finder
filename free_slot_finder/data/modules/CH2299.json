Through the study of material forms and the contexts in which they were created, we will look at the ways in which art, artists and their audiences responded to the challenges of modernity, reform, revolution, war, marketization and globalization. The phenomenon of Chinese contemporary art, its collection and connoisseurship, and the role of art schools, museums, biennales, galleries and auction houses will also be examined.", "Department": "Chinese Studies", "Types": ["UEM"], "ModuleCredit": "4"}
