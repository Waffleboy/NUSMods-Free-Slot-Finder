It considers the development of agency mission and goals, how programmes fit into those goals, how these goals and programmes interact with the environment of the agency and how planners work towards their initial acceptance by stakeholders and significant parts of that environment. Included is an analysis of how planners subsequently evaluate and present their outcomes. Bidding for grants and the presentation of information required to gain the support of funding bodies is an essential focus of the module.
