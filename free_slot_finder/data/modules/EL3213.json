In this introduction to typology, students will acquire a fundamental overview of the grammatical make-up of languages, and an appreciation for an important approach in contemporary linguistics. Language typology contributes to and draws on core areas of linguistics such as phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, psycholinguistics, sociolinguistics, and language acquisition, among others.", "Department": "English Language & Literature", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EL3213", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "EL2101", "children": []}, {"name": "EL2201", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
