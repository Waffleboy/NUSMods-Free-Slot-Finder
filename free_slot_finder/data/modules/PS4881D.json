Most polities claim to pursue public ends, yet many leaders have close links to private money. In democracies, elections are supposed to produce accountable officials, yet campaigns depend on funding from corporations and individuals. This module addresses questions about the \u2018dirty\u2019 side of politics and how private financing of political campaigns could be regulated: Why does vote-buying occur in some situations but not others? What is the role of organised crime in the business-politics nexus? How representative are elected leaders if they are also indebted to campaign financiers? These themes have wide relevance and we will study them in a variety of contexts, from local struggles in the developing world to American presidential elections.", "Department": "Political Science", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2010/2011", "Quota": "24", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "2830", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "550", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "1", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "34", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2010/2011", "Quota": "1", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "1443", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1443", "LowestBid": "600", "Semester": "1", "Round": "3B", "Bidders": "8", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2011/2012", "Quota": "24", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "1500", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "434", "LowestBid": "2", "Semester": "1", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "32", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2011/2012", "Quota": "1", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "1208", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1208", "LowestBid": "100", "Semester": "1", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "8", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2012/2013", "Quota": "29", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "1200", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "2", "Semester": "1", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "27", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2012/2013", "Quota": "2", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "60", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "53", "Semester": "1", "Round": "1B", "Bidders": "2", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}], "ModmavenTree": {"name": "PS4881D", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
