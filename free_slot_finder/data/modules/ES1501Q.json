This course engages students in exploring how English is shaped by the Anglo culture in which it was first used, and how its use is in turn shaped by other cultures. We will examine, in particular, Singlish (a variety of Singapore English) and how Singapore\u2019s multiethnic and multicultural heritage has shaped this variety of spoken Singapore English. Through the use of textual and multimodal sources, interactive discussions and critical reflection, students will engage in in-depth analysis and develop an understanding of the cultural literacy issues that affect English communication in Singapore and to showcase this understanding through well-reasoned academic writing.", "Department": "Ctr For English Language Communication",
