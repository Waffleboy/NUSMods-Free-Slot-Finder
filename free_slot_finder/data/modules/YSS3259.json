We will use novels, essays, plays, poems and visual media to consider characteristics and life events that make us uniquely human from birth through death: identity, human development, love and desire, coping with mental/physical illness, war, poverty, morality and resilience. We will read texts that are notable for their excellence (prize-winning) as well as diversity across time (classics to contemporary) and culture (e.g., authors from Asia, US, Europe). Critical reading, writing and discourse will be cornerstones of this course.", "Department": "Yale-NUS College", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "YSS3259", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
