It assesses competing explanations for longstanding issues, including the Taiwan issue, division of the Korean peninsula, South China Sea dispute, and trajectory of regionalism. These issues are playing out amid a major power shift, not only as a consequence of China\u2019s rise, but also with the emergence of Asia as a global agenda-setter. The course also examines the new threats to the region, from WMD proliferation to terrorism and competition for resources.", "Department": "Lee Kuan Yew School Of Public Policy", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "PP5158", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
