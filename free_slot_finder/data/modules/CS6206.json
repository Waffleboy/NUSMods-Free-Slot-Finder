Its aim is to examine both the theoretical bases that underlie the design of interfaces and advanced technologies for human computer interactions. A wide range of topics may be covered including psychological theories, organisational behaviour, virtual reality, augmented reality, and computer-supported cooperative work. The module illustrates where and when the theories are applicable, demonstrates the solutions using a combination of scientific theory understanding and engineering modelling. It also illustrates advanced technologies that form part of the solutions.", "Department": "Computer Science", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "CS6206", "children": {"name": "CS3240", "children": []}}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
