Is it necessarily true? Are there positive effects as well? This module will evaluate the link between the developmental process and the environment including an analysis of the problems, the proposed solutions, and the actual policies implemented.The module provides not only a Southeast Asian perspective on the environmental and the developmental issues facing the region, but also a geographical outlook. This emphasises the sharing of natural areas and resources among nation-states and their peoples in Southeast Asia given the historical background of the region with its impact on national borders and the composition of both the population and society. The outcome on nature and society relations seen in Southeast Asia reflect conditions specific to the region and its geography. This module is aimed at understanding both these specific conditions and the wider as well as external factors that have an impact on environment in Southeast Asia.", "Department": "Southeast Asian Studies", "ParsedPreclusion": "GE5215", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2011/2012", "Quota": "5", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2011/2012", "Quota": "5", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2011/2012", "Quota": "5", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2011/2012", "Quota": "5", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2011/2012", "Quota": "5", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2011/2012", "Quota": "5", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}], "ModmavenTree": {"name": "SE5294", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
