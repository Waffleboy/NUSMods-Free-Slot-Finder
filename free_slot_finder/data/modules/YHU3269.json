It will draw representative examples from the entire Anglophone world, beginning with Sir Thomas Wyatt (early sixteenth century England) and ranging through the centuries to contemporary poetry in English from all parts of the Anglophone world. The focus will be on how poets use the acoustic, syntactic and figurative resources of the English language to shape feelings and ideas into poetic artefacts.", "Department": "Yale-NUS College", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "YHU3269", "children": [{"name": "and", "children": [{"name": "YCC1111", "children": []}, {"name": "YCC1112", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
