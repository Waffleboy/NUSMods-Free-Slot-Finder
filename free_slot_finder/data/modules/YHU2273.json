The course provokes enquiry into the concept of continuity and change in music and how this reflects and affects social, cultural and ecological relationships. Lectures will critique examples and theories in the realms of sound as sound sculpture, acoustic ecology, musique concr\u00e9te, Deep ListeningTM, fabricated spaces, and aspects of performance art. Students will develop their understanding of the experimental music tradition through hands-on creative work through the design and productions of experimental musical materials. No previous music background required.", "Department": "Yale-NUS College", "ModuleCredit": "5"}
