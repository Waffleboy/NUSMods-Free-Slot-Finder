We will examine: (i) the factors that influence effective encoding, organisation, and subsequent retrieval of knowledge, (ii) how learners monitor and regulate their learning, and (iii) how expertise is acquired. We will also delve into the scientific literature to evaluate the effectiveness of various study/instructional strategies, and compare the research findings against our own intuitions (i.e., how we learn best may not correspond to how we think we learn best). We will consider the implications of cognitive science research for enhancing educational practice.", "Department": "Psychology", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "20", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "3387", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "887", "LowestBid": "570", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "29", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}], "ModmavenTree": {"name": "PL4880L", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
