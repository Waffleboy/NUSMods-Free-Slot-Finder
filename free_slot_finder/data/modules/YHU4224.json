Students will document processes using reflection and analysis. Discussion and research form an integral part of each process. Students will develop practical and theoretical understanding of the relationship between sound and movement, and how they intersect to generate and advance meanings and performative contexts. This course combines creative and critical practice, features a variety of reflective, analytical and practical assessment tasks, including a group performance project.", "Department": "Yale-NUS College", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "YHU4224", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "YCC1111", "children": []}, {"name": "YCC1113", "children": []}, {"name": "YCC1121", "children": []}, {"name": "YCC1131", "children": []}, {"name": "YHU3255", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
