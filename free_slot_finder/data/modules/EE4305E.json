It examines the principles of fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic, which leads to fuzzy inference and control. It also gives students an understanding of the structures and learning process of a neural network. Topics covered include: fuzzy set theory, fuzzy systems and control, basic concepts of neural networks, single-layer and multilayer perceptrons, self-organizing maps and neural network training.", "Department": "School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn", "ParsedPreclusion": "TEE4305", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EE4305E", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "EE2010E", "children": []}, {"name": "EE2023E", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
