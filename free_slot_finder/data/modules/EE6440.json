The spatial confinement considerably modifies light propagation and light-matter interaction. The syllabus covers broadly the topics of electron/photon-controlled nanoelectronics and includes light-matter interaction, optical cavities and waveguides, periodic structures such as photonic crystals, interpretation of photonic band diagrams, metamaterials, surface plasmons and nonlinear optics.", "Department": "Electrical & Computer Engineering", "ParsedPreclusion": {"or": ["EE5519", "PC5207"]}, "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EE6440", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
