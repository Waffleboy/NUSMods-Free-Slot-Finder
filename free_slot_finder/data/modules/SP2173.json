We will also visit the development of techniques that probe the microscopic domain and use some of them (spectroscopy, tunnelling microscopy) in hands-on experiments. We will conclude by studying novel, cutting edge topics such as fullerenes and graphene. Extensive use of computational tools (e.g. MATHEMATICA) will be made for simulations and surmounting mathematical barriers.", "Department": "Dean's Office (Science)", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "SP2173", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
