This module prepares students with the expertise of (higher-value-added) chemical product design for such companies. It covers the basic methodology with illustrative examples from many areas such as active ingredients and personal-care products. The module involves active-learning lectures and student teaching (with feedback from the lecturer and peers) so that students will gain competence of thinking divergently and critically, and confidently solving open-ended problems through group discussion.", "Department": "Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "40", "Faculty": "Engineering", "HighestBid": "4500", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "22", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "18", "Faculty": "Engineering", "HighestBid": "1000", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1B", "Bidders": "3", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "15", "Faculty": "Engineering", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "15", "Faculty": "Engineering", "HighestBid": "1", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "1", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "14", "Faculty": "Engineering", "HighestBid": "50", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3A", "Bidders": "2", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "13", "Faculty": "Engineering", "HighestBid": "2397", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "2397", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3B", "Bidders": "1", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}], "ModmavenTree": {"name": "CN4250", "children": [{"name": "and", "children": [{"name": "CN2116", "children": []}, {"name": "CN3132", "children": []}, {"name": "CN3135", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
