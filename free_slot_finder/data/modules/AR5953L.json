This module focuses on the ability to explore alternative design solutions as a means to inform the design and decision-making process. Without computational means, it is generally infeasible to consider more than a few design alternatives, even if the design solution space is uncountably large. Using techniques such as parametric/associative modelling, rule-based generation and more general algorithmic design generation allows defining and investigating a family or language of designs. Besides investigating one or more such techniques, we will also investigate the main characteristics of the design space and its structure.", "Department": "Architecture", "ModuleCredit": "4"}
