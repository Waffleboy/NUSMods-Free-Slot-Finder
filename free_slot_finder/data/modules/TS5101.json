Taking one example from each of three aspects of performance a script, a live performance, and a media/cultural performance the module trains students to examine and compare the critical positions and questions posed by a range of theoretical texts with different approaches, priorities and methodologies. Core topics are the mutually transformational modalities of textuality and performativity, live and mediated performance, and non-traditional critical and performance practices. Students are guided in formulating a research proposal and project, which forms the main coursework component.", "Department": "English Language & Literature", "ModuleTitle": "Text And Performance", "LockedModules": [], "ModmavenTree": {"name": "TS5101", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
