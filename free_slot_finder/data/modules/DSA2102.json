The\nemphasis is on the tight integration of numerical\nalgorithms, implementation in industrial programming\nlanguage, and examination on practical examples drawn\nfrom various disciplines related to data science. Major\ntopics include: computer arithmetic, matrix multiplication,\nnumerical methods for solving linear systems, least\nsquares method, interpolation, concrete implementations\nin industrial program language, and sample applications\nrelated to data science.", "Department": "Mathematics", "ParsedPreclusion": "MA2213", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "DSA2102", "children": [{"name": "and", "children": [{"name": "MA1101R", "children": []}, {"name": "MA1102R", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
