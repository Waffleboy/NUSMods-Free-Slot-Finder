Given that civic engagement and volunteerism are perceived as a crucial indicator of liveable society, it has been a concern of many countries including Singapore to increase voluntary associations and promote volunteering among citizens. This module thus pursues three main themes: (1) the relationship between civil society and civic engagement, (2) the precursors of volunteers (i.e., what makes people volunteer?), and (3) the outcomes of volunteerism (e.g., life satisfaction, health, or status attainment).", "Department": "Sociology", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "62", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "1000", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "8", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "54", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "1", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1B", "Bidders": "1", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "53", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "2", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "3", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "3", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Reserved for [G] in later round", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "50", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "27", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "23", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "2", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "3", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "7", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "2", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [G]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "60", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "1", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3A", "Bidders": "2", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P, G]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "59", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "1", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3B", "Bidders": "1", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P, G]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}], "ModuleCredit": "4"}
