The needs for sustainable design and its integration into a holistic performing building will be a key principle of studio\nlearning. Design decision support using simulation tools will be brought to life in studio environment in the realization of holistic sustainable building. Simulation tools\nwill be used for thermal, ventilation, IAQ, lighting and acoustics. Current sustainable building assessment techniques will be applied. Studio will be jointly conducted by academics and leading industry practitioners, particular focus will be given to sustainable building design covering both new build and retrofit of existing building.", "Department": "Building", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "BPS5112", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "8"}
