The final goal is to be able to apply these skills to solving realistic chemical engineering problems. MATLAB, a high-level computing language will be employed due to its capability to solve domain-specific computing problems more conveniently than with traditional programming languages. MATLAB also provides the platform to span a wide variety of application areas.", "Department": "School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn", "ParsedPreclusion": "TC1005", "ModuleCredit": "4"}
