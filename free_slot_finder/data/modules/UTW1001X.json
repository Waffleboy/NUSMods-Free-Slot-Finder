Why have abandoned sites, like derelict historical buildings and now-defunct prisons, become places of attraction today? This module examines the reasons for the emergence of \u2018new\u2019 tourist destinations, and the implications of these trends on local development and the environment. Using postcolonialism as a lens of analysis, students will explore the changing paradigms of tourist destinations and the resultant conflicts that evolve between different stakeholders, such as human rights organizations, indigenous communities, tourism operators, and tourists themselves. Topics covered include ethnic tourism, heritage tourism, danger (adventure) tourism, and dark tourism.", "Department": "Ctr For English Language Communication", "ParsedPreclusion": {"or": ["WP2201", "IEM1201", "ES1201G", "ES1501"]}, "ModmavenTree": {"name": "UTW1001X", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
