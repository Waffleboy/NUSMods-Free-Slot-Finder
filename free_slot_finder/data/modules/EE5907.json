The main objectives of this graduate module are to equip students with knowledge of common statistical pattern recognition (PR) algorithms and techniques. Course will contain project-based work involving use of PR algorithms. Upon completion of this module, students will be able to analyze a given pattern recognition problem, and determine which standard technique is applicable, or be able to modify existing algorithms to engineer new algorithms to solve the problem. Topics covered include: Decision theory, Parameter estimation, Density estimation, Non-parametric techniques, Supervised learning, Dimensionality reduction, Linear discriminant functions, Clustering, Unsupervised learning, Feature extraction and Applications.", "Department": "Electrical & Computer Engineering", "ParsedPreclusion": "TD5133", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EE5907", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "EE2012", "children": []}, {"name": "CS1101S", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
