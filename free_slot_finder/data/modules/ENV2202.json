These compromise coastal sustainability, which has serious implications for the well-being of coastal communities, particularly with the added impact of climate change. The more effective management modes to improve coastal resilience take into consideration the biophysical, socio-economic, cultural and governance aspects but implementation remains a challenge. Students will visit field sites in Sabah to analyse the site-specific issues and develop suitable management responses.", "Department": "Dean's Office (Science)", "Prerequisite": "For Environmental Studies students only.", "ModuleCredit": "4"}
