The\nemphasis of this course will be on model formulation and probabilistic analysis. Students will eventually be conversant\nwith the properties of these models and appreciate their roles in engineering applications.", "Department": "School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn", "ParsedPreclusion": {"or": ["DSC3215", "IE2100E"]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
