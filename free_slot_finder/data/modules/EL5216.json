With special reference to English, relevant topics will be introduced to suit particular needs; the corpus-linguistic methodology blends well with various linguistic levels, including grammar, lexis and discourse. This module does not assume any expert computing knowledge; while no computer programming will be introduced, participants will receive hands-on training in the use of standard corpus-linguistic programs.", "Department": "English Language & Literature", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EL5216", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
