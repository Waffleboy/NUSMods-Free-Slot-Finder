We will cover deterministic as well as stochastic inventory models. Although many of the topics we will cover are of great interest to managers, our focus will not be on practice but on theory.", "Department": "Analytics & Operations", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "BDC6113", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
