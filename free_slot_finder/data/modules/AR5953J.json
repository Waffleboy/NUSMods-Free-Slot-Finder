The designing and implementation of each system involves a breadth of considerations and tasks including analyses, simulation, optimization and control strategies, as well as responding to overall architecture intents and constraints such as performance, cost, buildability, site and size constraints. The deliverables of this module is working prototypes, and a written report.", "Department": "Architecture", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "AR5953J", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
