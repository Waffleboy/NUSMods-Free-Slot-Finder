Experimental economics, including lab and field experiments, builds on the premise that theoretical implications are subject to testing in controlled laboratory settings. There is a natural synergy between them and neuoroimaging and genetics leading to the development of neuroeconomics. This course covers the growing literature in behavioral and experimental economics, including neuroeconomics, and study individual differences in economic behaviour beyond those explicable by culture and socialization towards a deeper understanding of business and market behavior.", "Department": "Economics", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EC6884", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
