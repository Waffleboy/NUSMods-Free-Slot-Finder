Metaheuristic search methods including simulated annealing, tabu search, genetic algorithms, dynamically dimensioned search, and particle swarm. Both single objective and multi-objective methods are discussed. A theory section covers convergence of surrogate global optimization, simulated annealing, genetic algorithms, and the proof of the No Free Lunch Theorem. Statistical analysis for comparing algorithm performance is presented. Students will utilize existing software packages in Matlab or Python for surrogate optimization and for some metaheuristics.", "Department": "Industrial Systems Engineering & Mgt", "ParsedPreclusion": "IE6499A", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "IE6511", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
