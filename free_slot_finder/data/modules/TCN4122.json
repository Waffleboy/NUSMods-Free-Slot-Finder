Students learn a heuristic method for process development, simulation strategies, main steps in process design and rigorous process simulation using a commercial simulator through both lectures and many hands-on exercises. They will also learn detailed mechanical design of process equipment, cost estimation and profitability analysis of chemical processes.", "Department": "School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn", "ParsedPreclusion": "CN4122E", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "TCN4122", "children": [{"name": "and", "children": [[{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "TCN2116", "children": []}, {"name": "TCN2121", "children": []}, {"name": "TCN3124", "children": []}]}], {"name": "TCN3132", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "3"}
