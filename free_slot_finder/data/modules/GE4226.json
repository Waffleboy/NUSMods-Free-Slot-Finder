Drawing perspectives from the \u2018new\u2019 mobilities paradigm, it demonstrates how movement is not a sterile activity or zone, but a space replete with meaning. To exemplify this point, this course takes transportation as a lens of analysis, and interrogates its socio-cultural organization and experience.

Case studies will be drawn internationally, including Asia.", "Department": "Geography", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "11", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "3040", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "2000", "LowestBid": "175", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "23", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class 1"}], "ModmavenTree": {"name": "GE4226", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
