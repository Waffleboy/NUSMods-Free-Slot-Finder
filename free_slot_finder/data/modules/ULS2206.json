But scientific studies reveal that we are seeing only a tiny fraction of that world, and that what we do see (and hear, and smell, and touch) is not the world \u201cas it is\u201d \u2013 but as it is represented to us through the filters of our biology, or technology, and our culture. This module will examine the ways in which these three important forces enable, limit and shape the ways that we perceive \u201cthe world in front of us\u201d.", "Department": "University Scholars Programme", "Types": ["Module"], "ModuleCredit": "4"}
