As this module is intended to help students who are doing research in relevant areas to master both theoretical knowledge and practical techniques in areas of magnetism and magnetic materials, a significant portion of this module will be devoted to the coverage of various types of characterization techniques of magnetic materials. Apart from attending lectures, students will also have to do a presentation on selected topics relevant to contents covered in this module.", "Department": "Electrical & Computer Engineering", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EE6438", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "EE5431", "children": []}, {"name": "EE5431R", "children": []}, {"name": "EE5433R", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
