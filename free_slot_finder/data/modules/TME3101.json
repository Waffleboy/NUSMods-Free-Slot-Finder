The major project may be preceded by smaller projects to instill familiarity and experience. Elements of commercialization (e.g. market survey) and form-giving (aesthetics) may be incorporated. Students are required to submit a report, drawings, do a presentation, and take oral examinations. Effective group dynamics and experience of the process and problems involved in translating paper design to prototype are the key objectives of this module.", "Department": "School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn", "ParsedPreclusion": "TM3101", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "TME3101", "children": {"name": "TME2101", "children": []}}, "ModuleCredit": "6"}
