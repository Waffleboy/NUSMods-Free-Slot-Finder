In other words, what is a \u201ctiger\u201d when it is not just a zoo animal but one that lives in a forest next to your home? In this introductory and interdisciplinary course to conservation and the environment, we will watch films and discuss novels and ethnographies focusing on human/animal relations in six different spheres: Mountains, Deserts, Rivers, Plains, Forests, and Sea. The course aims to be an informative, provocative and fun introduction to an exciting and relatively new field of scholarship.", "Department": "South Asian Studies Programme", "ParsedPreclusion": "GEM1913", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "40", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "691", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "35", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [G]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "5", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "50", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "3", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [G]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "4", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "250", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "200", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3A", "Bidders": "5", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [G]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "4", "Faculty": "Arts & Social Sciences", "HighestBid": "1", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3B", "Bidders": "1", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [G]", "Group": "Lecture 1"}], "ModuleCredit": "4"}
