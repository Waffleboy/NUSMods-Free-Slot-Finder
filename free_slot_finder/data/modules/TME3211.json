This is an elective module and is intended for students in Stage 3 and 4 who have an interest in the stress analysis of isotropic and composite materials. The materials in this module are applicable to chemical, civil, mechanical and aeronautical engineering.", "Department": "School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn", "ParsedPreclusion": {"or": ["TM3211", "ME3211E"]}, "ModmavenTree": {"name": "TME3211", "children": {"name": "TME2114", "children": []}}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
