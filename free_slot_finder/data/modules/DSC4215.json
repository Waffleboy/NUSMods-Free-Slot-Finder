Students will glean insights from real world data, answer strategic business questions, create an Information Strategy for Supply Chain, Visualize and monetize Big Data. Real data sets from supply chain, retail, and social media will be placed in cloud technology like Google or Amazon. The students will use state-of-the-art tools to create amazing visualizations including SAP Lumira, Qlikview,Tableau, SVG, NetNode, and others. Practically, students will also learn about types of data available in a typical corporation, how this data maybe collected, shortcomings, bureaucratic / company's cultural issues. In this era of entrepreneurship we will also look at how startups/NGOs can visualize supply chain opportunities to attract and serve customers. To round out the course we will review the ethical and legal considerations of acquiring and using certain types of data. At the end they will develop the next generation of business analytics using cross-industry data mashups. The skills learned will be usable in other industries and the core concepts are technology agnostic.", "Department": "Analytics & Operations", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2014/2015", "Quota": "20", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "2199", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "13", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching R1"}, {"AcadYear": "2014/2015", "Quota": "7", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "1", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1B", "Bidders": "1", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching R1"}, {"AcadYear": "2014/2015", "Quota": "6", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching R1"}, {"AcadYear": "2014/2015", "Quota": "3", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Reserved for [G] in later round", "Group": "Sectional Teaching R1"}, {"AcadYear": "2014/2015", "Quota": "6", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "100", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "100", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "2", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching R1"}, {"AcadYear": "2014/2015", "Quota": "3", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Reserved for [G] in later round", "Group": "Sectional Teaching R1"}, {"AcadYear": "2014/2015", "Quota": "7", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "501", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3A", "Bidders": "3", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching R1"}, {"AcadYear": "2014/2015", "Quota": "4", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "1", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3B", "Bidders": "1", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching R1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "31", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "1000", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "11", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching R1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "20", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching R1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "20", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching R1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "5", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Reserved for [G] in later round", "Group": "Sectional Teaching R1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "20", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching R1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "5", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Reserved for [G] in later round", "Group": "Sectional Teaching R1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "25", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "1001", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3A", "Bidders": "2", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching R1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "23", "Faculty": "School Of Business", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Sectional Teaching R1"}], "ModmavenTree": {"name": "DSC4215", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
