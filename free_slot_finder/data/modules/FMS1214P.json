What makes these materials so different? In this module, we will explore why spider silk fibers are so strong from the point of view of structure, how the mechanical strength of fibers can be measured. The silkworm silk fibers will be used for comparison to the spider silk fibers. In addition, this module will demonstrate how fluorescent silk fibers are made from live silkworms. Students will be introduced to the fundamental concept of the hierarchal structure of soft materials and the mechanical performance in relation to the structure, and how to functionalize soft materials like silks.", "Department": "Physics", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "12", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "50", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1A", "Bidders": "7", "StudentAcctType": "New Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class Sl1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "5", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "1004", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "1", "Semester": "2", "Round": "1B", "Bidders": "5", "StudentAcctType": "New Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class Sl1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "3", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2A", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class Sl1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "3", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "2B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "Returning Students and New Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class Sl1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "3", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "300", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "1", "LowestBid": "300", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3A", "Bidders": "1", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class Sl1"}, {"AcadYear": "2015/2016", "Quota": "3", "Faculty": "Science", "HighestBid": "0", "LowestSuccessfulBid": "0", "LowestBid": "0", "Semester": "2", "Round": "3B", "Bidders": "0", "StudentAcctType": "NUS Students [P]", "Group": "Seminar-Style Module Class Sl1"}], "ModuleCredit": "4"}
