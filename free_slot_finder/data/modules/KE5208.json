Strategic data analytics based solutions can be roughly modelled at three levels: sensing, sense-making and decision making. This module focuses on sense-making which is the ability to describe, diagnose and resolve problem situations in a multi-sensor (up to thousands of sensors) environment. It complements existing MTech KE\ncourses by developing practical know-how in data processing, data analysis, event processing, data visualization and insights discovery techniques.", "Department": "Institute Of Systems Science", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "KE5208", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "3"}
