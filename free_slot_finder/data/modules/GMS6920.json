It is thus becoming necessary for scientists and physicians to have a foundation in intermediary metabolism in order to better understand the etiology of diseases and develop novel strategies for treating diseases. This 4-credit course offered at Duke-NUS will cover the basics in intermediary metabolism and the regulation of metabolism with special emphasis on human diseases related to metabolic dysfunction and adaptation. This course is tailored for students interested in cancer biology, diabetes, and for those students that have an interest in obtaining a general background in the biochemistry of metabolism. The class format will involve a combination of lectures and discussion and meet twice a week. Grading will be based on tests and a student presentation on a relevant research article.", "Department": "Duke-NUS Medical School", "ModuleCredit": "4"}
