However, its economic impact due to work lost caused by noise-induced health hazard was not realised until recently. Common remedy of using barriers is frequently not the most cost-effective way of combatingthis and an understanding of the noise-producing mechanism and changing it to a quieter process is always preferred if applicable. This course will lead the students from the basic fundamentals of acoustics through various noise-producing mechanismsand finally control measures that can be applied to different circumstances. The empahsis will be on the physical picture rather mathematical.", "Department": "Mechanical Engineering", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "ME5106", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
