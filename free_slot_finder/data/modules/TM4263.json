How the data between the manufacturing systems are transferred, their standard protocols are also covered. In addition the following topics are covered: Concepts of discrete-event modelling and simulation, definitions, types, essential elements in modelling, design and implementation of manufacturing simulation models, petri-nets, model verification and validation, input information collection and analysis, interpretation of outputs, use of random inputs and variance reduction techniques, protocol standards, communication topology, MAP/TOP.", "Department": "School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn", "ParsedPreclusion": "TME4263", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "TM4263", "children": {"name": "ME3162E", "children": []}}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
