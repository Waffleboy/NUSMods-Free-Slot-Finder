The chemistry of their formation, stability as well as the relationship between their structures and properties will be emphasized. After taking this module, students should have a good fundamental knowledge and understanding of how to design and to fabricate useful devices such as LEDs, optical switches, modulators, and dispersion compensators.", "Department": "Chemistry", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "CM5262", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
