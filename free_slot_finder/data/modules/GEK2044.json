The focus is chiefly on painting and sculpture; the emphasis is on analyzing the composition or design of art works and in constructing meanings for them. The study of this module enables students to acquire critical skills for interpreting and connecting with works of art. The module encourages students to read art works in relation to a range of interests, intentions and issues; the aim here is to suggest or propose contexts or environments in which art works are made and received. There are three sections. In the first, three (3) topics from Asian art traditions are discussed. The are : 1. Indian sculpture 2. Chinese landscape painting 3.
