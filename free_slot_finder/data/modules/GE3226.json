Using critical development lenses, the module will first critique \u201cbig D\u201d Development\u2019s (specific intentional interventions to achieve improvement or progress) globalized approaches in tourism development and then \u201crespond\u201d to these critiques by considering more localized political, economic, and cultural connections in tourism strategies. While localized \u201cdevelopment\u201d projects often suggest more equitable growth, input from local stakeholders, and incorporation of livelihood strategies and grounded knowledge, and more \u201csustainable\u201d models with a long-term sensibility, the module will take a critical position toward these ideas as well.", "Department": "Geography", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "GE3226", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
