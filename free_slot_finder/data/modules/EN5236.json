Examining literature produced by and about Asians living in Britain, Australia, North America, Africa, and the Caribbean, it probes the similarities and differences in the experience of migration as understood by different Asian groups, as well as by members of the same ethnicity inhabiting different regions. The course traces changes in mainstream attitudes towards Asian immigrants from racist demonizations to model minorities and their effect on literary production. Texts will be complemented by readings in Asian and Asian American Studies and postcolonial theory.", "Department": "English Language & Literature", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EN5236", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
