It examines a range of core empirical phenomena that have been important in the development of modern linguistic theory and that remain central to current linguistic frameworks (e.g. passive, infinitival constructions, relative clauses, wh-constructions, binding, etc.). Core theoretical notions to be covered include: phrase structure, grammatical relations, subcategorization, and lexical entries.", "Department": "English Language & Literature", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EL5101R", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
