This module begins with an introduction to the basic biology of fungal cells that make them a unique class of microbial pathogens. We also examine key molecular events in host-cell interactions and the different strategies by which fungi can evade immune-surveillance and establish pathogenicity. The significance of fungal pathogens in nosocomial infections and among the aged and immunocompromised will be discussed. There will also be a survey of the various aspects of diagnostic and therapeutic advances in the field to conclude the module.", "Department": "Dean's Office (Medicine)", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "MDG5219", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
