Methods for simulating nonlinear microwave circuits and processing of circuit parameters will be discussed. Major topics include: Linear circuit parameter conversion. Analysis of nonlinear microwave circuits. Lossy match, lossy feedback, distributed and power amplifiers. Oscillator theory; diode and transistor oscillators. Frequency multiplication, division and synthesis. Microwave frequency conversion, mixer analysis, single-ended and balanced mixers, diode and transistor mixers, image rejection, mixer noise.", "Department": "Electrical & Computer Engineering", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EE5303", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "EE4101", "children": []}, {"name": "EE4104", "children": []}, {"name": "EE4112", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
