Topics considered include protein folding, binding equilibria, self-assembly of biomolecules, membrane energetics, among others. Some questions addressed are: why are lipids essential to life, what drives ions across membranes, how do proteins bind to receptors, how can physics of biopolymers (DNA, proteins) explain their function, how can we explain spontaneous order formation in biology?", "Department": "Yale-NUS College", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "YSC3234", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
