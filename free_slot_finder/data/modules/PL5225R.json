Specifically, regression analysis, path analysis, confirmatory factor analysis will be formulated within the general framework of structural equation modeling. Advanced topics, such as ordinal data analysis, missing data, multiple-group analysis and latent growth models, will also be covered. After the course, students are expected to know how to conduct the analysis and interpret the results themselves.", "Department": "Psychology", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "PL5225R", "children": [{"name": "and", "children": [[{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "PL2101Y", "children": []}, {"name": "PL2131", "children": []}, {"name": "PL2102Y", "children": []}, {"name": "PL2132", "children": []}]}], {"name": "PL5221", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
