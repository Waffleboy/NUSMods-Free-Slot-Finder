It adopts a cross-disciplinary and practice-related perspective in its examination of competing and overlapping interests and the relevant theories and principles of state regulation driving these fast-developing areas. It also examines the roles, rights and obligations of the Government as a regulator, the government-linked entities as market actors, businesses and individuals, and considers \"market inefficiencies\" relating to accountability, independence, legitimacy and transparency. Students are required to evaluate current substantive law and institutional norms and processes, review comparative models and approaches in other jurisdictions, and propose a model of optimal regulation in one selected area.", "Department": "Law", "ModuleCredit": "5"}
