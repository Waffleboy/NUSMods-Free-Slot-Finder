This allows us nowadays to test biological events at the single molecule level. The module aims at introducing the interested student to the practical basis to achieve good images. Students will perform hands-on experiments on the different microscopes in the Centre of Bioimaging Sciences and will get a basic training to allow them to take images independently.", "Department": "Biological Sciences", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "BL5232B", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "2"}
