In a symbiosis of historical understanding of structural theory, construction and engineering architecture emerges. The Module focuses on materials and construction techniques within different environmental and climatic conditions. The rules of structural engineering are used to explain Architectural Forms. The principles of construction in Architecture are explained and the possibilities for sustainable solutions in Design will be explored. Lectures are accompanied with hands-on assignments to explore and explain Structural and Design Logics. It covers in greater depth, important aspects of Architectural Construction and Buildings Structures, whereby it provides basic knowledge on construction and structural systems applicable and necessary for Architectural Design.", "Department": "Architecture", "CorsBiddingStats": [{"AcadYear": "2012/2013", "Quota": "153", "Faculty": "School Of Design And Environment", "HighestBid": "50",
