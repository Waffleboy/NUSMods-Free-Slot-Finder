It is, however, not a programming course. It will focus on case studies from the most commonly used tasks that a business analyst will face on a day-to-day basis and how R could be used to handle such cases. The topics covered in the course include foundations of R programming, data visualization, regression-based data modelling, classification, and social media analysis.", "Department": "Analytics & Operations", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "DSC4217", "children": [{"name": "and", "children": [{"name": "DSC1007", "children": []}, {"name": "DSC2008", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
