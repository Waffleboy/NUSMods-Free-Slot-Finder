Similar to EPP I, students will first learn the fundamental principles on certain advanced concepts and then design and programme a real-world system. The module involves designing a complex computer engineering system that facilitates information processing, real-world interfacing, and understanding the effects of certain useful metrics such as, scaling, safety, security, sustainability, societal impact, fault-tolerant design, etc.", "Department": "Computing & Engineering", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "CG1112", "children": [{"name": "or", "children": [{"name": "CS1010", "children": []}, {"name": "CG1111", "children": []}]}]}, "ModuleCredit": "6"}
