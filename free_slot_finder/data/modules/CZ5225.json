This syllabus is similar to CZ4225 but the workload is higher. Proteins: sequence =>structure =>function. Protein structural organizations and families. Basic modeling and simulation techniques. Protein structural modeling: homology modeling, threading, ab initio methods. Cell as a complex machine: Genetic and protein circuits (pathways). Deveolpment of a mathematical model of pathways. Computer simulation of pathways.", "Department": "Pharmacy", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "CZ5225", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
