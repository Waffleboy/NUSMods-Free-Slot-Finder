The fundamental theory of conventional antenna arrays is covered in the first part. In the second part, the latest developments and techniques in multi-antenna communications are described, such as smart antenna technology, MIMO communication technique, adaptive array beamforming, etc. The focus of this module will be on the antenna array as a realization method to enable multi-antenna communications. The array design techniques will be highlighted and emphasized. The effect of antenna and array configuration characteristics on multichannel simultaneous communications and the dependence of the multi-channel ommunications on the antenna arrays will be fully illustrated and exemplified in this module.", "Department": "Electrical & Computer Engineering", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "EE6832", "children": {"name": "EE5308R", "children": []}}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
