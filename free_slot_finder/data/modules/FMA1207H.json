Introduced by Michel Foucault in the 1970s, the concept of biopolitics has been one of the most critical tools in investigating the control and regulation of different levels of human life\u2014from individual bodies to populations. Through examining the production and use of medical and scientific knowledge of human life in imperial, colonial, and national histories, this module explores historical processes in which human lives gradually came to be included in various practices of political power.
