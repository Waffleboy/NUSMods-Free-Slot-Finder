Theoretical explanations will be followed by hands-on tutorials with relevant computational software. Students will learn how to perform some of the most commonly used statistical analysis of experiments (e.g., z and t tests, ANOVA analysis) as well as to interpret the results of typical bioengineering experiments by building a suitably fitted mathematical model.", "Department": "Biomedical Engineering", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "BN2102", "children": {"name": "MA1506", "children": []}}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
