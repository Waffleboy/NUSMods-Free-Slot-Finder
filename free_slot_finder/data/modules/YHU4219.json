This course will consider what Sanskrit and Anglophone philosophers have to say about speech acts. We will start with Mima\u00bfsa, known as the \u201cscience of sentences\u201d, and think about how commands and exhortations work. We then turn to J.L. Austin\u2019s seminal How to Do Things with Words, which introduced speech act theory to Anglophone philosophy. The course will close with some contemporary attempts to integrate Mima\u00bfsa and speech act theory.", "Department": "Yale-NUS College", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "YHU4219", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
