Population models in ecology, financial growth, heat conduction, and water waves are a few examples. In this course, students will solve the classical linear ordinary and partial differential equations. Students will assemble a toolbox of mathematical techniques to solve initial and boundary value problems, including integrating factors, separation of variables, and Fourier series. Though not prerequisites, students are strongly encouraged to take either Linear Algebra or Mathematical Methods before this course. A solid grounding in Calculus is essential.", "Department": "Yale-NUS College", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "YSC3230", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
