The growing phenomenon of government contracts, especially contracts concluded with foreign nationals, refutes the traditional belief that contract is the domain of private law. This course offers an in-depth examination on how the presence of a government as a proper party to a contract moves the entire analysis on contract formation, performance, breach and dispute settlement to the domains of public law and general international law. It also offers critical perspectives on the mooted confluence of comparative public law and international law to obtain bespoke rules and principles for the regulation of government contracts.", "Department": "Law", "ModmavenTree": {"name": "LL4235V", "children": []}, "ModuleCredit": "5"}
