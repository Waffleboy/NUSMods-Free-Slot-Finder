Although some important new physical processes are introduced, the main emphasis is on the use of these to the design-analysis of industrial systems. The use of empirical data for situations where detailed analysis is difficult will be demonstrated through the solution of design examples. The main topics include: Heat exchangers with phase change; Boiling; Condensation; Combined heat and mass transfer; Heat transfer enhancement; Cooling of electronic equipment; and Design examples.", "Department": "School Of Continuing & Lifelong Edn", "ParsedPreclusion": {"or": ["TM4225", "ME4225E"]}, "ModmavenTree": {"name": "TME4225", "children": {"name": "TME3122", "children": []}}, "ModuleCredit": "4"}
